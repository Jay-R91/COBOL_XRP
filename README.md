COBOL XRP Simulator

A premium niche tool designed for simulating XRP transactions using GnuCOBOL—engineered for speed, precision, and reliability. Built to leverage the core strengths of COBOL: exact cent-level arithmetic (via COMPUTE/SUBTRACT to eliminate rounding errors), high-performance sequential file I/O (faster than most databases for persistence), and clear, maintainable structured sections.
Perfect for smaller financial institutions still relying on outdated payment systems like SWIFT, this tool provides a bridge to modern crypto technology—no blockchain fees, no confirmation delays. Ideal for fintech demonstrations, COBOL developer training, or crypto integration pilots.
Available in three flexible formats:
• $99 perpetual license
• $49/month hosted lease
• $499 commercial integration license
